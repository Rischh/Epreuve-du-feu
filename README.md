# 🔥 Epreuve du Feu

This repository contains a collection of algorithmic exercises and coding challenges, showcasing my approach and solutions to various classic problems in computer science.

All exercises are developed under specific constraints to enhance code clarity and robustness:

- **Clean Code principles**
- **Functional programming Paradigm**

These constraints help build more predictable, testable, and modular code.

## 📂 Contents

Here is the list of implemented exercises:

1. **Display a Rectangle in the Terminal** — _(Custom implementation)_
2. **Evaluate an Expression** — _(Shunting Yard algorithm)_
3. **Find a Shape in a Board** — _(Custom implementation)_
4. **Sudoku Solver** — _(Backtracking algorithm)_
5. **Find the Largest Possible Square on a Board** — _(Custom implementation)_
6. **Find the Shortest Path in a Maze** — _(A\* pathfinding algorithm)_

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**

Chosen JS because it is the main language used in my upcoming job. This project also serves as a way to deepen my understanding and fluency in JavaScript through practical algorithmic challenges.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Before you begin, make sure you have git installed on your system:

```bash
git --version
```

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/epreuve-du-feu.git
cd epreuve-du-feu
```

## 💡 How to Use

Make sure you have the appropriate runtime installed:

**Node.js ≥ 14**

Example :

```bash
node feu00.js 5 3
```

Each file is self-contained and can be executed independently.
